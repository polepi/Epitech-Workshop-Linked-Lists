# Linked List Workshop

## Purpose of the Workshop

In this workshop, you'll discover and hopefully master the use of Linked Lists. Linked Lists are an extremely powerfully concept in C, and once mastered can help you to massively boost your performance in future projects here at Epitech.
At first, it can be a very hard concept to understand, but you can't really avoid them, at some point this year you'll have to use them for a project, either you like it or not. The earlier you understand them, the better, and they WILL help you out decreasing lines of code and the complexity of your projects.

If you complete this workshop successfully, you basically have 50% of a future project called "organized" here at Epitech basically complete.

For the projects "my_ls" and "my_top" it will simplify the structure of your code, making it easier to move forward with the projects.

For the graphical module, making it modular with the use of Linked Lists will allow you to go faster, have less code (meaning less coding style issues) and reuse your code for future graphical projects.

Once mastered, Linked List are an amazing way to prevent core dumped and memory leaks of untracked mallocs across your projects.

### Exercice 1

Create a function that adds a brand new node at the first position of the linked list (to the head).

### Execrice 2

Create a function that adds a brand new node at the end of the linked list (to the tail).

### Exercice 3

Create a function that frees the contents of the linked list.

### Exercice 4

Create a function that prints the contents of the linked list from the head to the tail.

### Exercice 5

Create a function that returns the first instance of a node in the linked list containing certain data.

### Exercice 6

Create a function that removes a node from the linked list based on a certain position.
